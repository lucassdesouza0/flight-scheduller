## TODO (Next steps that I'd tackle with more time)

1 - Total coverage of tests for the entire application: Unit, Component Tests and E2E (Cypress)

2 - A better component structure, leveraging decoupling for better debugging and development.

3 - Refine the theme colors and token creating a more robust style kit
